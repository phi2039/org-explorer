# Feature Backlog

* Undo/redo
* Excel (csv?) import wizard

* Tags and ontology (e.g. Function: Product Management)
* Tabbed interface
* Open "Focus" view in new tab
* File metadata
* "Library" view for previous files
* "Link to file" for child orgs (so that the main file isn't so unwieldy)
* "Focus" stack for incremental navigation in/out
* Move zoom controls to lower-right corner floating control
* Shade "Cut" nodes
* Edit in place
* Notifications dialog for file I/O errors
* Search for node (then focus, edit, etc...)

# Issues

* Reset focus button (still) not working in release build
* Zoom container content does not grow to remain centered
* Schema validation for loaded files
* Delete backup on exit (unless there was an error)

# Resolved(?)

* "Save As" should update current file name (verify overall that save functionality is working...)
* Can't reset selection in release build
* Default fields and enter-key action for forms
